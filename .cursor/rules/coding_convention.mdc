- Comments should be written in English.
- Procedurally written using __try2 for while(0) and __leave2 for break. Overall, use the __try2 { } / __finally2 {} / return template.
- __leave2 is not used for for, while, or switch loops.
- Do not return based on branching within a function. Returns are handled at the end of the function based on an error code or return type.
- For == or !=, write the constant or rvalue on the left and the lvalue on the right.
- The ! operator is not used and is written in the form (nullptr == condition) or (false == condition) or (0 == condition).
