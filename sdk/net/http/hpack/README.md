# HPACK implementation

## 1. Role

This document identifies the module or protocol area represented by this file.

## 2. Model

This directory implements HPACK, the HTTP/2 header compression format.

The source provides the HPACK encoder and the static/dynamic table handling built on the common HTTP compression infrastructure. Protocol framing remains under the HTTP/2 implementation.

## 3. Important behavior and lifetime

Implementation details and behavior are described where the existing source-tree notes provide evidence.

## 4. Example from the source tests

See the referenced testcase sources for concrete examples. Where no direct test is identified, this is not evidence of runtime verification.

## 5. Relationships

Related implementation areas and protocol boundaries are recorded here where identified.

## 6. References

Source references and related documents are retained here where available.
