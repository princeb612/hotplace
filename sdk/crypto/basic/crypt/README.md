## 1. Role

### Encryption and AEAD primitives

This directory implements encryption primitives and AEAD support.

The source includes the generic encryption/AEAD abstractions and builders together with OpenSSL-backed cipher implementations. The implementation covers the cipher-oriented layer used by higher crypto protocols.

Algorithm-specific compatibility and lookup information is handled separately by the crypto advisor.

## 2. Model

The model, structure, or retained explanatory material is described where the existing source-tree notes provide evidence.

## 3. Important behavior and lifetime

Implementation behavior is documented only to the extent supported by the retained notes and source references.

## 4. Example from the source tests

See the referenced testcase source files for concrete examples. A source reference alone does not prove runtime execution.

## 5. Relationships

Related implementation modules and protocol boundaries are recorded here where identified.

## 6. References

Relevant source paths, sibling documentation, and standards references are retained here where available.
